# a method that returns the sum of two integers

# Casual:
# Given two numbers
# add the two numbers together
# return the sum

# Formal:

# START
# Given two integers called "number1" and "number2"
# SET result = number1 + number2
# PRINT result
# END


# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# Casual:
# Given a collection of strings, or words
# separate the collection into individual strings
# join the strings together to form one string
# return the joined string

# Formal:
# START
# Given an array of strings called "words"
# SET strings = split array into individual words
# SET result = strings joined together to form one string
# PRINT result
# END


# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# Casual:
# Given a collection of integers
# iterate through the collection one by one
#   - save every other value into another collection
# return the new collection

# Formal:
# START
# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"
# SET iterator = 0
# SET new_array = empty array
# WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
#   if item in numbers at space iterator is odd
#     append item to new_array
#   else
#     go to the next iteration
#   iterator = iterator + 1
# END
